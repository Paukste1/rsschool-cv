        <p>3. Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of t intrigued me in school, but not enough to choose programming for
        my bachelors. Instead I chose physics. I believe that an understanding of logic and numbers is key in programming, which
        I have developed in university. I now only lack the knowledge of programing languages and processes. I'm an eager
        learner and I strive to optimize everything I do on a regular basis, nts on freeCodeCamp in the:"(New) Responsive Web
        Design" e you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)</p>

        <p>5. "Catphotoapp", "cafe menu", "CSS colors by building a set of colored markers" from freeCodeCamp</p>
