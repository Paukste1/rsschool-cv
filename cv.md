3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
My main goal is to give programming a go. It intrigued me in school, but not enough to choose programming for my bachelors. Instead I chose physics. I believe that an understanding of logic and numbers is key in programming, which I have developed in university. I now only lack the knowledge of programing languages and processes. I'm an eager learner and I strive to optimize everything I do on a regular basis, because I believe, it is one of the best ways to save time.
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
I have a basic understanding in C++ and fiddled around with HTML.
5. Code examples (LATEST)

freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
